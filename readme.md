# Dorkfiles

Configuration files for macOS, just the way I like it. Pretty dorky, if you ask
me.

Based heavily on [dbalatero/dotfiles](https://github.com/dbalatero/dotfiles).

## Installation

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jameslittle230/dorkfiles/master/bootstrap)

cd ~/.dorkfiles
./setup
```
